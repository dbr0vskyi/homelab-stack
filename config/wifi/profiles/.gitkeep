# Sample network profile configurations
# These can be used as quick setup templates for common scenarios

# Each profile contains connection settings for different environments:
# - Home network (primary residence)
# - Office network (work environment)  
# - Mobile hotspot (emergency connectivity)
# - Public WiFi (coffee shops, hotels, etc.)

# Profiles are referenced by the WiFi management scripts for quick setup
# and can be used to restore standard configurations after network changes
