# Workflow Guide

Two automated workflows for productivity:

## ÔøΩ Workflow Management

### Import Workflows to n8n

Import workflow files from the `workflows/` directory into n8n:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh import-workflows
```

**What it does:**
- Validates all JSON workflow files
- Cleans up metadata that could cause conflicts
- Imports workflows using n8n CLI
- Automatically detects and uses the correct project ID
- Skips invalid files with detailed warnings
- Verifies successful import

**Output Example:**
```
[INFO] Importing workflows to n8n using CLI...
[INFO] Found workflow files in workflows/:
[INFO]   - gmail-to-telegram.json
[INFO]   - telegram-to-notion.json
[SUCCESS] ‚úì Successfully imported workflows to n8n
[INFO] Verifying imported workflows...
[SUCCESS] Current workflows in n8n:
[INFO]   apv2HH0a1EfNcMRd|gmail-to-telegram
[INFO]   sz6q4bQXIXzMymmb|telegram-to-notion
```

### Export Workflows from n8n

Export workflows from n8n to the `workflows/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh export-workflows
```

**What it does:**
- Exports all workflows from n8n database
- Saves each workflow as a separate JSON file
- Uses workflow name for filename (sanitized)
- Validates exported JSON format
- Overwrites existing files

**Use Cases:**
- Backup workflows before changes
- Version control your workflows
- Share workflows with team members
- Migrate workflows to another instance

### Test Workflow Sync

Run comprehensive diagnostics on workflow management:

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh test-workflows
```

**Tests performed:**
1. ‚úì n8n CLI availability in container
2. ‚úì Database connection and workflow listing
3. ‚úì Local workflows directory validation
4. ‚úì Export functionality test
5. ‚úì Import capability check

### Troubleshooting

If workflows don't appear in n8n UI after import:

1. **Refresh the web interface** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check workflow status** - Workflows may be inactive by default
3. **Verify project** - Ensure you're viewing the correct project in n8n
4. **Check logs** - Run `docker logs homelab-n8n --tail 50`
5. **Re-import** - Try exporting and re-importing

Common issues:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Invalid JSON" | Malformed workflow file | Validate JSON with `jq empty workflow.json` |
| "Project not found" | Wrong project ID | Script auto-detects from workflow files |
| "Duplicate workflows" | Multiple imports | Normal - n8n creates new versions |
| "Workflows not visible" | Browser cache | Hard refresh browser |

**Verbose Logging:**

For detailed debugging, check the script output. The scripts provide:
- ‚úì File-by-file validation status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings for skipped files
- ‚úó Error messages with specific issues
- üìã Complete import/export summaries

## ÔøΩüì± Telegram ‚Üí Notion Tasks

**Purpose**: Convert Telegram messages to structured Notion tasks using AI

**Flow**: Telegram ‚Üí Ollama AI ‚Üí Notion ‚Üí Confirmation

### Setup
1. Import workflow: `./scripts/manage.sh import-workflows`
2. Open n8n web interface (https://your-domain/)
3. Find "telegram-to-notion" workflow
4. Configure credentials:
   - Telegram Bot API token
   - Notion API token + database ID
   - Verify Ollama connection (automatic if running)
5. **Activate the workflow** in n8n UI
6. Test: Send "todo: Review budget by Friday" to bot

### Usage Examples
```
"todo: Review quarterly budget by Friday"
"meeting: Team standup tomorrow 9am"  
"urgent: Fix server issue ASAP"
"note: Research new automation tools"
```

## üìß Gmail ‚Üí Telegram Summaries

**Purpose**: Daily Gmail scan with AI-powered email summaries

**Flow**: Gmail Scan ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Telegram Summary

### Setup  
1. Import workflow: `./scripts/manage.sh import-workflows`
2. Open n8n web interface
3. Find "gmail-to-telegram" workflow
4. Configure credentials:
   - Gmail OAuth2 credentials
   - Telegram Bot for notifications
   - Set `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in environment
5. Adjust schedule (default: daily 8am)
6. **Activate the workflow** in n8n UI
7. Test: Run workflow manually (Execute button)

### Features
- Scans last 24h of unread emails
- Filters important/actionable emails
- AI summarizes with priority levels
- Sends formatted digest to Telegram

## üîß Customization

### AI Model Selection
- **Fast**: `llama3.2:1b` (basic summaries)
- **Balanced**: `llama3.1:8b` (good quality)  
- **Quality**: `qwen2.5:14b` (detailed analysis)

Edit the Ollama HTTP Request node in workflows to change models.

### Filtering Rules
Edit workflows in n8n to customize:
- Email importance detection keywords
- Task extraction patterns
- Summary formats and lengths
- Notification preferences

## üìä Monitoring
- Check n8n execution history in the UI
- Monitor logs: `./scripts/manage.sh logs n8n`
- Test workflows manually before scheduling
- Export workflows regularly for backup: `./scripts/manage.sh export-workflows`

## üîê Credentials Management

**Important**: Workflows reference credentials by ID. When importing workflows:

1. Credentials are NOT included in exports (security)
2. You must configure credentials in n8n UI after import
3. Workflow nodes will show ‚ö†Ô∏è  until credentials are set
4. See `docs/workflows-setup.md` for detailed credential setup
