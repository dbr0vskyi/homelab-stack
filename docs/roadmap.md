# üó∫Ô∏è Homelab Stack Roadmap

This document tracks planned improvements, fixes, and enhancements for the homelab automation stack.

## üìã Current TODOs

### üî• High Priority

#### 1. Comprehensive System Monitoring & Logging

**Status:** Planning  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Description:**  
Implement extensive logging system to monitor Raspberry Pi health metrics and centralize all logs with web access.

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Monitor system metrics (temperature, CPU throttling, CPU usage, RAM, disk space)
- [ ] Centralize Docker container/service logs
- [ ] Merge logs with timestamps for unified view
- [ ] Provide web-based log access interface
- [ ] Set up alerts for critical thresholds

**Technical Approach:**

- **Metrics Collection:** Prometheus + Node Exporter for system metrics
- **Log Aggregation:** Loki for log collection and storage
- **Visualization:** Grafana dashboard for metrics and logs
- **Web Access:** Grafana provides web interface for both metrics and logs
- **Integration:** Add to docker-compose.yml, minimal config required

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add Prometheus, Loki, Grafana to docker-compose.yml
2. Configure Node Exporter for system metrics
3. Set up Promtail for log shipping
4. Create Grafana dashboards for system health
5. Configure alerting rules for critical metrics
6. Document access and usage

**Files to Modify:**

- `docker-compose.yml` - Add monitoring stack services
- `config/` - Add monitoring configurations
- `docs/` - Add monitoring documentation

#### 2. N8N Task Runner Implementation

**Status:** Research Required  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

**Description:**  
Investigate and implement task runner for n8n as mentioned in official documentation to improve workflow reliability and performance.

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Research n8n task runner capabilities and benefits
- [ ] Assess current workflow performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement task runner configuration
- [ ] Test workflow performance improvements
- [ ] Update documentation

**Research Questions:**

- What specific benefits does the task runner provide?
- How does it impact resource usage on Raspberry Pi?
- Are there configuration requirements for existing workflows?
- Does it require additional services or just configuration changes?

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Review n8n official task runner documentation
2. Analyze current n8n configuration and performance
3. Configure task runner in docker-compose or n8n settings
4. Test existing workflows with task runner enabled
5. Document configuration and performance improvements

**Files to Modify:**

- `docker-compose.yml` - Potentially update n8n service configuration
- `docs/workflows.md` - Document task runner setup and benefits

#### 3. Reverse Proxy with Traefik Integration

**Status:** Planning  
**Priority:** Medium-High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Description:**  
Implement Traefik reverse proxy for better Docker integration, SSL termination, and service routing.

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Replace direct port access with domain-based routing
- [ ] Automatic SSL certificate management (Let's Encrypt integration)
- [ ] Docker service auto-discovery
- [ ] Load balancing capabilities for future scaling
- [ ] Dashboard for monitoring proxy status

**Benefits:**

- Cleaner URLs (e.g., `n8n.homelab.local` instead of `localhost:5678`)
- Automatic HTTPS for all services
- Better security with centralized access control
- Easier service management and scaling
- Integration with existing Tailscale setup

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Add Traefik service to docker-compose.yml
2. Configure Traefik with Docker provider
3. Add labels to existing services for auto-discovery
4. Set up SSL certificate management
5. Update Tailscale integration for new routing
6. Create Traefik dashboard access
7. Update all documentation with new URLs

**Files to Modify:**

- `docker-compose.yml` - Add Traefik service and labels to existing services
- `config/traefik/` - New directory for Traefik configuration
- `scripts/setup.sh` - Update setup process for new routing
- `docs/` - Update all documentation with new service URLs
- `.env.example` - Add Traefik-related environment variables

### üîß Medium Priority

#### 4. Enhanced Backup System

**Status:** Improvement  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

**Description:**  
Improve existing backup system with automated scheduling, retention policies, and health checks.

**Current State:** Basic backup scripts exist  
**Improvements Needed:**

- [ ] Automated backup scheduling (cron integration)
- [ ] Configurable retention policies
- [ ] Backup health verification
- [ ] Remote backup storage options (S3, etc.)
- [ ] Backup monitoring and alerting

---

#### 5. Service Health Checks & Auto-Recovery

**Status:** New Feature  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

**Description:**  
Implement comprehensive health checks for all services with automatic recovery mechanisms.

**Requirements:**

- [ ] Docker health checks for all services
- [ ] Service dependency management
- [ ] Automatic restart policies
- [ ] Health status monitoring
- [ ] Integration with monitoring system

---

### üéØ Low Priority / Future Enhancements

#### 6. Container Security Hardening

- [ ] Non-root user configurations
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Network policy implementation
- [ ] Secrets management improvement

#### 7. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Resource usage monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Caching layer implementation
- [ ] Database performance tuning
- [ ] Workflow execution optimization

#### 8. Multi-Environment Support

- [ ] Development/staging environment configurations
- [ ] Environment-specific compose files
- [ ] Configuration templating system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Monitoring Stack Choice: Prometheus + Loki + Grafana

**Rationale:**

- **Prometheus:** Industry standard for metrics, excellent Docker integration
- **Loki:** Lightweight log aggregation, pairs well with Prometheus
- **Grafana:** Unified dashboard for both metrics and logs, extensive visualization options
- **Alternative considered:** ELK stack (too resource-heavy for Raspberry Pi)

### Reverse Proxy Choice: Traefik

**Rationale:**

- **Excellent Docker integration:** Auto-discovery via labels
- **SSL automation:** Built-in Let's Encrypt support
- **Lightweight:** Suitable for Raspberry Pi resources
- **Configuration:** File-based and dynamic configuration support
- **Alternative considered:** Nginx Proxy Manager (less Docker-native)
